  Bibimbap is a Korean rice dish. The term "bibim" means mixing rice(burned rice at the bottom of the dish and cooked rice),
  while the "bap" noun refers to rice. Bibimbap is served as a bowl of warm white rice topped with namul (sautéed and
  seasoned vegetables) or kimchi (traditional fermented vegetables) and gochujang (chili pepper paste), soy sauce, or
  doenjang (a fermented soybean paste). A raw or fried egg and sliced meat (usually beef) are common additions. The hot dish
  is stirred together thoroughly just before eating. In South Korea, Jeonju, Jinju, and Tongyeong are especially
  famous for their versions of bibimbap. In 2011, the dish was listed at number 40 on the World's 50 most delicious foods
  readers' poll compiled by CNN Travel. The exact origin of bibimbap (비빔밥) is unknown. People could have started mixing
   bap (rice) with banchan (side dishes) after the outdoor jesa (rites), such as sansinje (rite for mountain gods) or
  dongsinje (rite for village gods), where they needed to "eat with the god" but did not have as many cooking pots and
  items of crockery to hand as they would normally have at home. Jeonju Bibimbap is an old-fashioned and delicious dish.
  Some scholars assert that bibimbap originates from the traditional practice of mixing all the food offerings made
  at an jesa(ancestral rite) in a bowl before partaking of it. Ordinary people ate bibimbap on the eve of the lunar new
  year as the people at that time felt that they had to get rid of all of the leftover side dishes before the new year.
  The solution to this problem was to put all of the leftovers in a bowl of rice and to mix them together. Farmers ate bibimbap
  during farming season as it was the easiest way to make food for a large number of people. Bibimbap was served to the king,
  usually as a lunch or a between-meal snack. There was more than vegetables in this bibimbap.</p>
